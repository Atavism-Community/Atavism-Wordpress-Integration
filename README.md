# Atavism-Wordpress-Integration
GPLv2 or later WordPress goodness for the Atavism Community.

quick starter list.

Add license the github way.
Add some git flow tips for folks that don't know.
most of that can be a wiki page with some links.

wiki's:
Tutoiral 5 minute setup of the integration (if possible)
screenshots


Some wishlist stuff found in Discord previously. I did not go real slow.

- integration with Wordpress using Wordpress plugin (preferable with elegant themes, as it's the most powerful site builder for Wordpress)
- multiserver/world handling
- payment integration (xsolla)
- presentation of user characters
- presentation of user character items
- presentation of user character statistics
- handling ban
- handling support tickets
- integration with woocommerce (free Wordpress store solution) for a store and subscription handling (subscription is handling by paid extension)

And of course server status

Less thought out wishes:
ip based security for the authenticator
chatban is atavism side... would have to be done in the chat controller/websocket plugin.
mail integration like wp-mail-bank
bug tracker
tickets
woo subsciptions


# Special thanks to all the work and help on Discord so far and esp. @smzero
Scott Meadows is being contacted about the contribution and Copyright of the work those far. A GPLv2 was listed in his readme drop on Discord.
Other chat history can be archived for historical purposes if desired. Lets do this right!

# Fun Facts:
https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/atavism
From French atavisme. 
Noun[edit]
atavism (countable and uncountable, plural atavisms) 
The reappearance of an ancestral characteristic in an organism after several generations of absence. quotations ▼
The recurrence or reversion to a past behaviour, method, characteristic or style after a long period of absence. quotations ▼
(sociology) Reversion to past primitive behavior, especially violence. quotations ▼
Usage notes[edit]
Can be used both positively, to refer to past or ancestral characteristics, or pejoratively, referring specifically to past primitive characteristics. 
A rather formal term; in popular speech the circumlocution skip a generation is often used for traits that occur after a generation of absence.
